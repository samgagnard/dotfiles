# dotfiles

My recent conversion to zsh and a number of related articles/blogs have inspired me to take greater care of my dotfiles and back them up to github. The information and examples at http://dotfiles.github.io/ proved to be a great help in this. 

These are my personal dotfiles and are a bit sparse at the moment (work in progress). If you stumble upon this page, I'd recommend checking out the above article and the other references I have below.
